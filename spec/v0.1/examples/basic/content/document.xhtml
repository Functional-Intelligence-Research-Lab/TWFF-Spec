    <h1>Harnessing the Wind: A Path to Sustainability</h1>
    <p>
        Wind energy has emerged as one of the most promising renewable sources.
        <span id="wind-intro">Global wind energy capacity has been observed to double approximately every three years</span>,
        it now powers millions of homes. However, challenges such as intermittency
        and land use remain.
    </p>
    <p>
        Innovations in turbine design and energy storage are addressing these issues.
        For instance, floating offshore turbines can access stronger winds without
        visual pollution. Meanwhile, AI‑driven predictive maintenance reduces downtime
        and costs.
